# Emoji-Distribution
This project tests the hypothesis that emojis sent in private chats fit Zipf's distribution law, and if every person has a unique distribution parameter.

*Zipf's law* was originally formulated in terms of quantitative linguistics, stating that given some corpus of natural language utterances, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc. 
Example, word distribution in Romeo and Juliet (source: medium.com/datadriveninvestor/zipfs-law-breakdown-application-in-app-development-5e9cda70cdc8):
